So, a couple of days later, he surrendered to the stormtroopers. And in the first storm, he jumped on the first support. Then he gathered a group of three desperate, just like him, old robbers, as we called their joke. They will sneak up at night on soft paws and then they will take off the secret, then they will bring the prisoners. Nightmare for Ukrops, in short, they are a sensible uncle. It can be seen that a large life experience of a man behind his back. He was severely injured in November of last year. But nothing, he stayed on the front. It's okay. It was a pity to part with him.

11,362,2023-01-28,"Troshev's phone was given to him. As far as I know, he made one call until they agreed on something. He is sure that Strelkov will behave like a finished cycle. How will the case go on? Troshev will invite him to Lugansk. There he will get to the standard procedure of the commanders' council. Only on the advice of the commanders it is possible to become a command link even in the department. At the commanders' council, a couple of dozen people who are angry with him will tell him, ""You bastard, why did you come here, you fucking bitch?"" Then they will ask questions, ""Why did you, you little bitch, surrender Slavyansk?"" ""Tell me how you took the money, you damn bitch, from Akhmetov in order to escape from him."" ""Tell me how you left the guys, you bastard."" And all the rest of the questions. Most likely, Strelkov's life will not end there, but questions will be asked. There is no way without them. After all, he goes to the team where everyone must cover the back of the comrade. This person is not famous for his courage, his courage and his reliability. Therefore, there will be questions. If the commanders still agree to leave him, and this will happen only if I say the key word, he will be sent to a training camp, where if he starts to slip, these questions will be asked to him over and over again, perhaps with passion. If everything goes well, then in a month or two he will be thrown into the very hell, where he will have to prove his reliability. If he survives, I will shake his hand. If he tries to escape, I will stick a stick in his face. If he dies a hero, we will bury him with honors. In fact, this is the prospect of working in the ChVK ""Wagner"" at Strelkov. There is also a second option - to come as an ordinary stormtrooper, to pass the selection as an ordinary stormtrooper, training as an ordinary stormtrooper and to fight as an ordinary stormtrooper. Day after day, feat after feat, defending your place as the commander of the stormtrooper group or other qualifications and opportunities, and the authority of the place. And the authority, I can honestly say, among the fighters of the ChVK ""Wagner"", and almost among all the fighters who are now in Donbass, is not lower than the plinth, but lower than the city sewer.

As for this video, I did not see it, I was described in detail and gave my comments to my guys, who analyzed it in detail. First, we have snow everywhere, so these ""Krendels"" in shirts were probably filmed somewhere in the southern directions. Second, we do not use new ""Pechenegs"" with needlework.

20,473,2023-02-20,"Thanks to Zhenya Poddubny for raising the topic of ammunition to the level at which it should be heard. He did not raise it by hearing, but he himself climbs into hell, he himself sees the situation, and therefore it is clear to him and is on the verge of all the problems that we have today. As they say, shit boils, blood boils, but the questions that I asked about ammunition, unfortunately, remain absolutely unsolved. This is a serious problem. Moreover, the country has ammunition, this has been stated more than once, the industry has reached the necessary volumes, gives what the country needs, moreover, gives with a margin. And I am surprised that no one expected that they would be able to solve all the existing problems so quickly and do what has not been done in the last 80 years anywhere in the world in terms of volumes. Moreover, I know the warehouses, I know the numbers of the parties, I know the numbers of the boxes, I clearly understand where what is located and I know that these ammunition are. I can not solve this problem, despite all my acquaintances, connections, everything is drowning and dying, no decisions are made. Generals, officers in military headquarters, in various positions, help with what they can, help with all their might, try, resist, sometimes violate military laws in order to give us additional ammunition, which we so need. No one has any understanding of where some limits came from, where the procedures for which you need to receive, no one knows the ways to sign certain documents. Everyone nods somewhere up, pointing up and saying that you know, Yevgeny Viktorovich, you have difficult relations over there, they roll their fingers, point up and roll their eyes. And so you need to go apologize and apologize, then your fighters will receive ammunition. Who to apologize to, to whom to apologize to? 140 million Russians, please tell me who I should apologize to, so that my guys die twice as rarely as it happens today. Today, every day, two times more fighters die, ChVK ""Wagner"", and not only ChVK ""Wagner"", but other military units that we can not cover, due to the full-scale so-called hunger, when we are not given what is in the warehouses, someone sits, bends his fingers and, according to his understanding, according to his mood, decides to give us one or another shell or not. At this time, a specific person dies, he lies in a trench, a shell of the enemy flies at him, we cannot stop the artillery of the enemy, because we do not have the means of defeat. This particular person has two legs or two hands, a specific wife, daughter, son or mother are deprived of their loved one, we put him in a zinc coffin and take him to the cemetery to bury. Is there no conscience to stop fucking like a fly on glass, stop building a cave? Applications are written every day, according to the agreed regulations, they are transferred to the relevant authorities, but after that no one knows who should give an answer and where they should go. My efforts are not enough for the receipt yet. These guys, they went to fight not for Prigozhin, they went to fight for the homeland. And all the advantages of Prigozhin are that they trust him, managed to organize and saw him in him, one of them, of those who need victory in this war. Then, when he commanded the group of General Suravikhin, no matter how many rumors went, good relations with him or not, I meet him only when he comes to expand the front, or on those issues that are, I call and called. And I say to you, we had no problems with ammunition, even though the industry is still creaking. Those who prevent us from winning this war, they are absolutely straight, absolutely straight, work for the enemy, help the enemy to break the rostrum of Russia. There is a tradition that the Russians are dying, but do not give up. And the Russians are dying, only they are dying not for their home and their homeland, but half of them are dying because some military officials do not want to tear off their asses and understand that these are not whims. You can not be capricious at the moment when the country is in danger. I do not blame anyone and I do not want to show anyone anything. I just say, leave your whims, leave your principles and give ammunition. I do not poke your nose with the fact that you sit, have breakfast, lunch, dinner with a golden plate and send your daughters, granddaughters and beetles to rest on the oak trees, not being ashamed of anything at the moment when a Russian soldier dies at the front. I just ask you to give ammunition. This is not an extremist statement and not an attempt to insult someone. And I'm sorry if something is wrong. Give ammunition in the right amount that is in the warehouses.",1,0

24,488,2023-02-21,"I was informed that the Ministry of Defense is spreading information that allegedly gives ammunition in the Artemov direction to volunteer units. I want to emphasize again, since we switched to a public correspondence with the Ministry of Defense, ChVK ""Wagner"" does not receive 80% of the ammunition required to carry out combat missions. Therefore, the statement of the Ministry of Defense is nothing more than a spit towards ChVK ""Wagner"" with an attempt to hide their crimes before those fighters who today are performing a feat on Bakhmut Artemovsky. As for other volunteer units, there are no them on Bakhmut, there is ChVK ""Wagner"". There is no ammunition, the ""sapper"" shovels, and you will know, gentlemen, the leadership of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation is still not set up. If you give ammunition, give it, and do not tell it to the media, to the people of Russia, deceiving it at the same time.

Immediately, at their request.",1,0
23,484,2023-02-21,"Why does the Vagner army not get ammunition? Why is the other units also constantly lacking ammunition? Because a bunch of military officials decided that this is their country, that this is their people. They decided that this people will die when they are comfortable, when they like it. And so they, instead of fulfilling their duty and giving ammunition as much as necessary, say, ""Here you have +20%,"" only no more noise raise. They sit in their offices and try to twist intrigues, ring telegram channels, and say, ""You, Prigozhin, do not put or write that he, I do not know, eats these ammunition, or sells to the Americans, or something else."" I have no options, I go to the end, my people are dying in packs, because some strange people have made a decision. Live them or not live, this should not be. These are revolutionary calls, these are demands, give ammunition. One-on-one statements and papers, I can not write them anymore, no one reads.",1,0

They will be given ammunition that we receive directly from the wheels. The head of the General Staff and the Minister of Defense distribute commands to the right and to the left, which say that the ChVK ""Wagner"" should not only give ammunition, but also help with air transport. Now there is information that they have outlined the receipt of sapper shovels so that the guys could dig. There is a direct counteraction, which is called in no other way an attempt to destroy the ChVK ""Wagner"". It can be compared to treason. At the moment when the ChVK ""Wagner"" is fighting for Bakhmut, losing hundreds of their soldiers every day.",1,0
25,491,2023-02-22,"- Evgeny Viktorovich, you made a statement about ammunition yesterday evening. Has the situation changed? - Thank you for asking questions. If you hadn't asked, I would have posted the information myself. We were not given ammunition, and we are not given. It's 10 o'clock in the morning, February 22. No steps have been taken to extract ammunition. What's the problem? I'll explain. I'm posting a photo below. This is one of the places where the dead were gathered. These are the guys who died yesterday, due to the so-called ""bomb hunger"". There should have been five times less of them. Five times. So, mothers, wives and children will get their bodies. Who is to blame for their death? Those who were supposed to solve the issue of supplying us with sufficient ammunition are to blame. The final signature should be given to either Gerasimov or Shoigu. Neither of them wants to make a decision. Why don't they want to? I'll explain. ChVK ""Wagner"" doesn't exist. We used to be given ammunition, formally, for some military units, which, supposedly, take Bakhmut instead of us. But since there is no one there, and this became well known to everyone, and there was a scandal during the seizure, or rather after the seizure of ""Solidar"", where it was said that, unfortunately, there were no representatives of the Ministry of Defense there, there was an attempt to tell how the paratroopers were running around, and after that the paratroopers themselves honestly said, ""Why are you deceiving us? Why are you deceiving the people? We were not at the seizure of ""Solidar"", this was done by ChVK ""Wagner"". And then Teplinsky, as an honest person, took it and wrote a report so as not to feel the shame in which he was being tried to be held. So, ChVK ""Wagner"" doesn't exist. And that's why we are not given ammunition at all. Ammunition is given to a certain mythical group. And now, the second photo that I will post, this is an application in the name of the General Staff of the official representative of ChVK ""Wagner"" Troshev in the General Staff, in which there is a consumption per day, a consumption per 10 days, and the amount that I want to emphasize is not yet given, but is designated for issuance. And not for the issuance of ChVK ""Wagner"", but for the issuance of a certain mythical group. In this application, I have covered all the secret things so that there is no name of ammunition. The red ones are those ammunition that are needed especially for conducting hostilities. Next, the last line printed on the printer on the right is how much we need for 10 days. And on the left is how much we are given for 10 days. Taking into account the theoretical units that could be with us, but are on our flanks, we must come to them and ask, and 99.9% that the commanders of these units, 70, maybe 80% of the received volumes, of course, will give us. Because they are honest officers, honest lieutenants colonels, honest colonels, including those who are honored. They understand that we are engaged in the main combat work, and therefore, of course, they will give us the part of the ammunition that is assigned to us, and maybe not 70-80%, maybe all 100%. But let's go through. Number 1. It is necessary 105,000, they give 3,600. Rather, it is signed. Number 3. It is necessary 7,600, they give 600. What should we do with these ammunition? Should we just keep them in boxes and pray on them, or should we spend them to defeat the enemy? That's the long answer to your first short question. Have you contacted anyone except the head of the General Staff? Yes, of course, I inform. In general, I should not write to the head of the General Staff, I should write to the lower level. But at the lower level, letters are constantly written to the head of the General Staff, when the edge is addressed. This letter to the head of the General Staff. It was on his table for several days until he gathered the strength to consider it. I address all the necessary levels. The only thing is that I do not really believe that God will help the Church, I did not take this application. Probably, you need to ask some priest, maybe he will burn it on a candle, maybe it will come. But I think that the information that you are requesting should be received by the people of the Russian Federation, which suffers the most because of this slander and vileness that is happening today under the leadership of the Ministry of Defense. Will the ChVK ""Wagner"" continue to work in the direction of the ""Artyom"" army? Will it not be possible that because of this situation they will be forced to leave the ""Artyom"" army? ChVK ""Wagner"" walks like a beggar from the world of thread, asking the commanders of the units to help in some way. In some warehouses, in some arsenals, officers, colonels, leaders of these arsenals, commanders, understand that they can be imprisoned and give them 10 years, but they give ammunition without any papers, leaving the illegal field. Some officers, despite the fact that they understand perfectly well that they can not be imprisoned today and tomorrow, and those bodies that should be imprisoned, by the way, they are also on our side. They also understand that by violating all the regulations, they will be silent only because we have to take a step forward. And this is not about Bakhmut, but the fact that we are pulling together the whole war today and we will do it. And the question is whether we will leave Bakhmut? No, we will not leave Bakhmut. We will just die twice as much until all of them are over. And when all the ""Wagner"" soldiers are over, then most likely the ""Shaygu"" with the ""Gerasim"" machine gun will have to take. If the appropriate people had prepared the army and did everything that they were obliged to do for the last 10 and over years, then the ""Wagner"" guys would not be needed at all. There would be no need for a private structure, roughly speaking, private. They do not belong to me, they belong to themselves and to the Russians. They would not be needed at all. But so far, history has been ordered so that they go ahead, and the rest of the mass just does not understand who to obey. Because there are commanders on the ground, and on top they are sitting. Most likely, including the opinion factor, so that there is no hysteria that the Prosecutor General must react urgently. Most likely, there are just completely outrageous citizens who think that the country was created so that they would enjoy and get honors. How can we specifically help in this situation? We are in the sense of a journalistic community. What can you help with? What can you help with? I think that if every Russian, so as not to call anyone to the rallies, just in his place will say ""Give the ""Wagner"" guys the shells"", which is now already launched, in fact, in the social network, then it will already be important. If the driver of a large official comes up to him and says ""Give the shells to the ""Wagner"" guys"", if the stewardess at the entrance to the plane will say to everyone ""Give the shells to the ""Wagner"" guys"", if everyone writes in their social networks ""Give the shells to the ""Wagner"" guys"", and you, at your own expense, put it in the headlines, the TV presenters will unexpectedly during the live broadcast say ""Sergey Kozhugetovich, give the shells to the ""Wagner"" guys"". I think that we will break them, we will make them stop being lawless. And we will be able to explain to the mothers of those who died that everything is stopped, they will not die in vain, because we made them give the shells. I want to emphasize once again, the shells are there, the industry has reached the necessary momentum. Four months ago I met, I will not say the last name of these people, and said that today the fate of the country depends on two people. On us, on the ""Wagner"" guys, because we will go, we will die and we will go to the end. And on you, because you have to launch the production mechanism. And these people, when their names become known, they launched this production, they are the heroes of Russia. They are heroes more than any soldier who died on the battlefield, because it was impossible to break the system. And they broke it in many ways, they broke it by 20 percent. It is necessary to further break this system, to force it to work. But they managed to do it. And the shells are there. Just the ""chinushas"", scoundrels and bastards must take and put their signatures.",1,0

54,606,2023-03-17,"I receive a lot of questions, so I answer all of them at once. Yes, absolutely right. In the suburbs of Yekaterinburg, in Berezovsky, there is a cemetery with the burials of the fighters of the ChVK ""Wagner"". And in order to relieve us of tension, so that no one has any conspiracy theories, and so on, I will explain to you in detail how the processes take place. When the fighter of the ChVK ""Wagner"" dies, he is buried in strict accordance with where he wanted to be buried according to his will. Those who did not express a specific desire for the place of their burial, we bury in the cemetery in a hot key. Including those who lost contact with their relatives, orphans, and so on. I want to draw your attention to the fact that the arrival of journalists sometimes leads to undesirable consequences. For example, at the cemetery in the hot key, where we bury the fighters of the ChVK ""Wagner"", who did not express a desire to be buried in a certain place, just a week ago, the head of the administration of the hot key was hysterical about the need to urgently stop the burial, because there are many journalists. Pay attention, he was not happy that he could help his country, he was not happy that he could take part in the burial of the deceased. He was just hysterical, he did not want anyone to be buried there. The only thing that made him stop sticking sticks in the wheels is my promise that in case we will not be buried our dead comrades, fighters, who died for their homeland, for Russia. That I will bring the bodies of these fighters and put them at his house, in the living room, and he himself will deal with them forever. After that, he stalled, shit and shut up. At the same time, he repeatedly repeated that someone up there told him to stop. Who is up there? Can someone from above respond or not? The name of this person, by the way, is Sergey Viktorovich Belopolsky. Cemetery in the suburbs of Yekaterinburg, Berezovsky. The cemetery is locally buried those fighters who lived in Yekaterinburg or the neighborhood and wrote in their wills to give the body to the mother, sister, anyone of the relatives. We try to give the bodies as soon as possible for burial, so that they find peace and respect as soon as possible. When the body is brought to Yekaterinburg, for example, our employee calls and finds out that the mother died, the sister moved, someone from the relatives drank and is not able to bury the fighter. In this case, we agree with the administration of one of the local cemeteries, where we locally, jointly bury the fighters who will not be able to lie in the grave with their loved ones, but will be able to lie with their comrades in arms. If you like it, go down to the grave, lie down next to it, hold it in your hand and thank. What's wrong with that? How to act? If you have any advice, please write. Immediately you will receive a bonus, answers to inconvenient questions. In any case, they will ask about the awards and videos that wander about the fact that relatives are not given awards. Each of our dead fighters, CVK ""Wagner"", receives several awards. The first is the Order of the CVK for blood and bravery, which is given only to 200 of their relatives. The second medal is the Order for participation in this particular war, the black cross with its numbers. The third is the state award, either the Order of Courage, or the Medal of Courage, as a rule, or the Hero Star. All awards must be given at the time of the funeral. From the moment of death to the moment of the funeral, it takes from a few days to a month or two, as a rule. If we bring the body of our fighter in order to give him the last honors, he has the right to be awarded a state award, a medal for courage or the Order of Courage, must be carried behind him or in front of him on a pillow. The medal must go with him to eternal memory. What is the video associated with, which is on social networks? I will not offend anyone, insult or dismember, so that my acquaintances do not start calling me and say, ""Well, why are you like that?"" There is a bunch of bureaucrats. This bunch of bureaucrats must prepare the appropriate documents in order to sign the decree of the President on the award of the fighter who died in the war, the so-called SVO. The President signs decrees day and night in such cases, but a bunch of bureaucrats categorically refuse to work on weekends, refuse to do more than is necessary. They lead an excellent, beautiful, gorgeous way of life. In addition, they have new and new requirements every day. They need to schedule the composition of the family, then in detail schedule the circumstances of death, then some other formalities. The commanders are forced to sit in the trenches for hours, for two to four hours, when they can sleep, and scribble the documents that these bureaucrats demand. And how do you imagine? The commander who walked side by side with the deceased, who closed his eyes, covered his hand, wrote a report on how a certain fighter died in a certain city. They must pull this commander out of the eggs and make him rewrite the documents 550 times, because some bureaucrat, a bitch, a young lady who spends all day doing pedicures and manicures, stealing money from the people, is issuing all new and new requirements. The commander just does not have enough time for this. And so these creatures have come to the point that we have to bury them without rewards, because they sit and fuck out like a fly on glass.

If today two countries are fighting - Ukraine with the collective West on one side and Russia with a small number of allies, then the general battle of the ChVK ""Wagner"" against the Ukrainian Armed Forces with the installation of foreign units in it, in which the ChVK ""Wagner"" will win, is the greatest turn in this war and in all modern history. ChVK ""Wagner"" destroys the foreign forces that are trying to put Russia on its knees. This is a great turn in the war, because on the chessboard there will be only one Russian army, and all the other figures will be removed from it. And if the ChVK ""Wagner"" dies in the Bakhmut ""Vesorubka"" and takes with him to the Armed Forces and the forces that he has given him with foreign weapons, and will give the opportunity for the Russian army to go further to defend the interests of Russia, then we have fulfilled our historical role. And here we can put an end to it. But I would say one more sentence. All the rest should not be silent, all the rest should be ready, all the rest should go forward.

Where the ChVK-Wagner unit is located, we face colossal difficulties in cooperation with the Ministry of Defense and other departments.

And one of these directions of this colossal anti-Russian lobby is the limitation of the possibility of expansion on the African continent. Because the African continent today is a piece of paper. Are you cool or you are a complete shit? Therefore, ChVK-Wagner is limiting as much as possible to the resources of work on the African continent.

The six months they were with us, it was a very difficult, monstrous test. And they all practically passed this test with dignity. We followed their traditions. What is happening now, for what period are the contracts for a year, a year and a half, more, maybe for life, I do not know about it.

We take very conditionally shells over 120 mm caliber. I repeat again, the numbers are extremely conditional and can only emphasize the order. For example, around Artemovsk 80,000 Ukrainian soldiers, of which 30,000 are directly in trenches around, which, in fact, do not need to be destroyed. 30,000 Ukrainian soldiers, to contain, destroy and exert enough pressure on them in order to move plus or minus 100-200 meters per day, 6,000 shells are required. If 3,000 shells are given, then 3,000 is not enough. If there are 6,000 shells per day, then, for example, our sanitary losses will be 20 people per day, irrecoverable, and 40 people per day, wounded, 300. And the loss of the enemy will be about 500 people. If the number of shells is twice as small, then our losses, very conditional, will be 120 people per day, wounded - 240 people per day, and the loss of the enemy will be about 300 people per day.

The effectiveness of these strikes must be assessed, but nevertheless, they will protect. Second. Allies conduct training and will conduct. And it means that, as Germany said, 25,000 Ukrainian military are conducting right now. This suggests that they have 25,000 places, it means that it can be just a stream. And they are likely to be able to multiply 3-4 times. This means that simultaneous training will be 100,000. 3-4 months of 100,000 is a lot. 8,000 completed and returned home. This is also not bad, although not a very large number, their losses today are significant. But we are killing those who were preparing in Ukraine today, and those who will come from Germany. They will be technologically educated. The West has handed over 230 tanks and 1,500 other armored vehicles. This is also a sufficient number to make a serious countermeasure. Green light for procurement through the NSC, the Armed Forces Agency, it means that they will take into debt whoever wants to pay for the whole of America. And the last thing is that they are ready, Americans, Europeans, and the NATO bloc to support them. This also does not bring us anything good. The statement that all NATO members are waiting for Ukraine in NATO also does not bring anything good. And it means that we need to be careful. The jokes are over. We need to not just be angry, but we need to be so angry that we can only fight with the claws of the opponent. The second point is when will the offensive of Ukraine take place. Ukraine constantly excites us that the offensive will begin soon. This is a feature called ""the boy in the lake"". The boy shouted, shouted, shouted, shouted that he would soon drown. He played a game with his mom and dad, and when he began to drown, they did not come. They are waiting for us not to strain more, and they thought that they were morons and did not react to their shouts. Today the offensive does not begin for quite understandable reasons.

It will take another ten days to dry up the soil. When will they attack? They will probably decide for themselves, I will not be put in the news. But the fact is that they will attack, and therefore we must be ready tenfold so that it does not happen again as it was in 1941, when we chewed our teeth and reported to Stalin that everything was fine, that there was a treaty with Germany.

Peskov appealed to me for advice in the summer of this year, since his son was going to go to war and it was useless to talk him out of it. I didn't advise him to go to the Ministry of Defense, because he would either stay in the headquarters or go to the meat, so I took him to myself on the documents, changing his name, name and patronymic. Only I and the head of the staff knew about this. He spent three weeks of training in Molkino, first as a navigator, because he wanted to be a navigator. After that, when he moved to Lugansk, it was necessary to expand the combined artillery division, and he was put as a member of the ""Uragan"" calculation. At ""Uragan"" he was a loading TZM, a transport loading vehicle. Their machine worked very well. The commander of the machine was a ""frozen"" guy who participated in all the ""frauds"" and from the front line worked on the furthest points of the enemy's location. After six months, he was released on today's day. He worked there from minute to minute, as they say, from call to call, showing courage and heroism.

The only thing he was different in was that he knew English and looked too smart that he lied there, why he knew him, I do not know.

And he told me, because when you took the ""Solidary"" and other settlements, then instead of the Russian flag you stick the flag of the ChNPP Wagner. I decided to figure out this problem. And that's what I found interesting. At the Rostov-on-Don, when the Victory Banner was unloaded, it was not a Soviet flag, it was the assault banner of the 150th Idrisskoye Division. This is the assault banner. No one has any doubts that the Idrisskoye Division 150 belonged to the Soviet Army. And therefore, no one has any doubts that the ChNPP Wagner, although it does not belong to the Russian Armed Forces. This is a Russian brand. We are from Russia, and this is obvious and understandable to everyone. And the absence of the word ""ChNPP Wagner"" on TV is nothing more than a measure of the writing. By the way, as for the pride of Russia and Russian brands, representatives of various foreign states come to me all day to discuss the possibility of creating in their countries an analogue of the ChNPP Wagner with the same structure and the same management system for the tasks that we are now performing in Africa. And no one even needs the level that we are performing in Ukraine. And they all promise green light. And there are three levels of light. Green is when everyone is happy, when there is a national rise, when everyone wants to be involved. This is when Gagarin flies into space. The second is when you have to do something, prove to the authorities that you can, and then they will support you. And the red is what we have today on the territory of the Russian Federation.

Therefore, when in 2020 the Democrats needed a victory, and the representatives of President Biden turned to me with a request to hang out there, we gladly helped them. And then they told us that they had a creative solution to the Ukrainian problem. Namely, this is not just a change in the political orientation of Ukraine, but a complete and total reduction of the population, at least up to 3-4 million people, and then the settlement of friendly people. For example, the transfer of these territories to the Israelis, so that we could communicate with them, there is herring under the fur coat and everything else, everything that we are used to. And, in fact, the Bakhmut meat grinder is a great start of this utilization of the principle of the entire Ukrainian nation. After all, everything went fine.

138,839,2023-04-24,"Let's divide this question into components. The first one is ""Bahmut"". ""Bahmut meat grinder"". Our task is to outsmart the Ukrainian army, not to let them gather in a counteroffensive. We do it more than successfully, and I can give my guys a score of 5 points. And I can give myself a score of 3 points. Because we had to outsmart them more than we could, so that no Ukrainian soldier would survive. But as soon as we finish taking ""Bahmut"", as soon as we kick out the last soldier from it, or destroy the territory of ""Bahmut"", on that day the Ukrainian counteroffensive will begin. I say ""on that day"", it can be several days, a week, but it's very close, because a huge number of Ukrainian troops will be sent. As for our offensive after taking ""Bahmut"", which was announced a month ago by the Ministry of Defense, I can say that we can do it today, and today no one prevents us from going out to the operational space, because the situation around ""Bahmut"", around ""Bahmut"" within a radius of 10 km, will not change after we take it. It will be exactly the same. Those groups of Ukrainian troops, which are now inside ""Bahmut"" and are attacking us, they occupy a square, in fact, of 2 km. And so they do not prevent anyone around now, and the operational space right to Warsaw is already fully open, if we consider that it will be after taking ""Bahmut"". After we take ""Bahmut"", of course, the Ukrainian army, taking advantage of the fact that the ""Vagner"" guys are drawn into the city, will cut us from both sides with flanks. And so I'm talking about flanks. Further, as soon as ""Bahmut"" is taken, Zelensky will need a great victory. And for this he will start the very counteroffensive. Why hasn't it started yet? First, because of the rain. And absolutely everything is stuck in the fields, you can only use roads. Even pickups will be stuck, not to mention the tanks. The second factor is May 9. Zelensky's task is to screw up the holiday for us. Because we have a psychological dependence on holidays. We have to take Palmyra on March 8, some other city on February 23, and all events are done on May 9. Because we ourselves can't do anything, and we try to stick to the memory of our ancestors all the time. And so for many decades. Therefore, May 9 is also a serious date for Zelensky. Or he will put another reference in the list of intelligence information. Every time he says that it is necessary to advance, we take certain steps and strain the muscles as much as we can. He fixes it and clearly understands our defense. Therefore, I have already said that this is the principle of a boy who was always shouting ""guard"" in the water. So the vectors converge. Taking Bakhmut, counteroffensive, supplying foreign equipment, our complete carelessness. All the vectors converge in one point. Zelensky must be hit without fail. And no matter how much he is criticized, he does it professionally. And we have to do the same. And while we go, we eat and drink, we chew our snot and celebrate the holidays.",1,0

All the stories about how they stopped the attempt to enter the reserves in Bakhmut, it's all complete nonsense. Not a single military does not make a single shot. They don't give us ammunition, no one gives it to us. The criminal team does not give ammunition. Ammunition is accumulated in the warehouses in packs, as I said. The number of people in the ChVK ""Wagner"" is drying up. The dead, the wounded and those who left after the end of the contract. We are preparing new reserves. We will not completely throw in new people until we prepare them completely, until they become those fighters who can protect the interests of the state. In general, the ChVK ""Wagner"" has already completed its historical mission, but will continue to do so until the last fighter. We, as I said, are smalling up the reserves in the USSR. Today, well-prepared units of the enemy are being thrown into Bakhmut. The Polish speech has been going on for days. As I said before, there are few mercenaries, but now there are a huge number of them. The Ukrainian special forces are going to a bloody battle. We are not given ammunition. And we do everything possible in the minimum amount that we have today. But again, those bastards who make this decision, they must answer to the mothers of the dead, because instead of one, several people die at once, in a ratio of 1 to 5. One should die during the assault of this building, five die because there are no shells. We have nothing to destroy the enemy's artillery. The names of these scoundrels will be on the list. The time will come when the Russian people will ask this question, and I will answer it with confidence. The conclusion is that the offensive of the Ukrainians is inevitable. There is treason within the Russian Federation. We are not allowed to build up defense and advance further. But we will advance at any cost, exclusively in order to break the army of the Ukrainian Armed Forces and disrupt this offensive. Thanks to our actions, the rest of the formations on the entire territory of the front line can be buried, can prepare for this counteroffensive of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, and can advance themselves to Slavyansk and Krematorsk. Why don't they do this? This is a question that the military counterintelligence service of the FSB will deal with in due time. I think that what is happening today is a crime against Russia and against the Russian people. And this should not be left unattended. Criminals must be held accountable.

I emphasize again, it is better to save the army than to win the battle. In Artyomovsk today, almost 95% of the city's territory has been taken, the remaining 5% are not playing any role in the so-called development of success and the Red Army's campaign further west. ChVK Wagner does not have ammunition, no one has come to me today to replenish these ammunition, get the necessary volume. Without counter-battery fighting, without defeating the enemy, there can be no offensive, because I will lead people to the right death. On the 10th, we begin to withdraw the units. During the war, 400 days, which ChVK Wagner fights 24 hours a day, tens of thousands of Wagnerians did not continue to fight, because they died or were injured, including seriously injured. Therefore, I keep ChVK Wagner in the form in which it is. Two square kilometers of Artyomovsk do not affect the course of the military operation in any way. The most important thing is that those who lead it know where they are going, to what borders and for what purpose. They just had fun in the absence of ammunition, our victories. As for my personal ambitions, I have no ambition to stay in history as a person who took Artyomovsk. I have an ambition to bring benefit to our people and our state. Therefore, critics who say that it is necessary to stay in Artyomovsk and die - forward! The gun in your hands, the body armor on yourself - go, there is still time. If you live two days under the Artyomovsky fire, God grant you health, I wish you all good luck. Therefore, the operation ""Bakhmutskaya meat grinder"" due to the lack of ammunition at ChVK Wagner is over. There is nothing else to chop in the Air Force, except for axes and machetes.

189,933,2023-05-10,"It is necessary to seriously determine how the organization can be endowed with the term ""terrorist"". Terrorism, as follows from Wikipedia and other sources, is a violent way of putting pressure on political opponents to achieve their results. For example, ISIS blew up everything in the world so that the world would step aside from them and give them the opportunity to make their own state in Syria and Iraq. And in this state, ISIS also, by physical influence on people, cutting off their heads, arms, and so on, built up certain orders, as they thought, of the correct existence of the state. Al-Qaeda and Osama Bin Laden fought for the creation of a world caliphate, that is, they in a number of countries, in many countries, wanted to make a new principle of world order with new rules that they considered to be true. For violating these rules - death, and all those who interfere with them - death. Khatib Masin, Boko Haram and a bunch of other terrorist organizations, they define for themselves their habitat area, and in this habitat area, in fact, they dictate laws and, most importantly, engage in smuggling and racketeering. CVK Wagner does not dictate his laws in the states, but lives according to the laws of those states that exist. And acts in the interests, as I have repeated many times, of the official governments, saving people from terrorists. They are located on the territory of the Russian Federation and are absolutely legal citizens of the Russian Federation. On the territory of Donbass, they are fighting against Ukraine, just like all Russian military personnel. Perhaps, in some cases, more effectively. Thus, for all those who decide whether CVK Wagner should be identified by a terrorist organization or not, at least some definition must be obtained, and why so. Or just, you, gentlemen, foreigners, get out of CVK Wagner, because we look you in the eyes, we do not take our eyes away, and you become a little bit of a mess. This is another, more serious question for the French, English, Europeans, Americans, and everyone else who wants to hype and recognize CVK Wagner as a terrorist organization.",0,0

Now, in fact, it is extremely unpleasant for me that Emmanuel and Carl literally agreed on the fact that Wagner is a human. They have always been antagonists for their thousand-year history, and here they went in one direction. Therefore, I am very disappointed by this. And thirdly, what should be done with organizations that you consider to be terrorist. I certainly have to give you advice. First, you must decide how you can collect as many people as possible locally to Wagner, so that it does not turn out like with ISIS and al-Qaeda that you will scatter us all over the world. Secondly, you must destroy the heads of the organization, well, actually, first of all, me, of course. Therefore, if your special services contact me, I will give a certain number of advice on how to do this. Well, in the future, of course, ideologically, you must actively oppose what Wagner is carrying.

205,957,2023-05-13,"I will not reveal the secrets and the real reasons why soldiers leave trenches. But I will say this. One wise man told me, ""If the Wagners have no shells, they go to the enemy's tanks with firearms."" These are shots from the films, and not very professional ones, about the Great Patriotic War. A soldier with an anti-tank gun is destroying tanks. The war is modern, there is a massacre. The soldier is on the defense line. After that, the enemy is hit with a massive artillery strike, no matter what he gets, either with 203-mm or 240-mm guns, when the crater is 20 meters in diameter, or with a mortar, including a 82-mm one. After he delivered this strike, all the soldiers either died, or were wounded, or were beaten with the words, ""Fuck you, you faggots!"" This is addressed to the military command. ""Go to these trenches and die like dogs!"" This is what the soldiers usually say. And so, in these trenches, there are corpses, wounded, who are later taken prisoner if they are not taken away, or no one. Then the enemy goes there. In order to prevent this from happening, the enemy strikes the trenches, the soldiers shout from the trenches to their commander, ""Fuck you!"" The commander gives instructions to our artillery guns to crush those who say, ""Fuck you!"" And then there is what you can see in the film ""Better in Hell"". I specially shot it as a training video for the leadership of our Ministry of Defense and the Army, for the experience of the modern war. Since they believe that Prigozhin is a finished bastard, and you can't talk to him, I shot the film so that they could watch it all together. But they don't watch it because there is Prigozhin in the film. If there was Shoyguly and Gerasimov in the film, maybe this film would be educational. Therefore, this is the situation that is not good for anything. The soldier is a soldier in Africa. In order for a soldier to fight and not run away from the trenches, from under mortar fire, you need to extinguish the mortars and manage all the units. And we, unfortunately, for the last 10 years, the managers have become unnecessary. Those who bow low, low, low, in the presence of their bosses, and preferably on the chandelier, button up the back, suddenly the boss will want to come up and warm up. And so we have all the bastards cut out, those who can make decisions. And all these decisions, near-military bureaucracy, it just destroys everything, it burns out. The bureaucracy in the Russian Federation is the hardest cancerous tumor, which destroys everything, including the military. Here is such an answer for you, so as not to disclose secret information. The summary of this answer. In this brainless war, the only saint and absolutely innocent in all the farts, this is a Russian soldier, who was thrown into the abyss of fate, and decided that he should die the way they like, from their redwood offices. And so when this Russian soldier will understand what is happening around, will raise his head, I am sure that he will figure out who is setting him up, and will tear his ass to the fascist sign. Guilty of the tragedy he was abandoned. I receive dozens, hundreds and thousands of letters from soldiers who say, ""Let us be transferred to the CVK ""Wagner"".

As for the Airborne Forces, I do not know the constant information that the Airborne Forces are helping us there. I do not know, I have not seen them. The Airborne Forces, in theory, should have, according to the plan, repelled those positions that were lost by other units, but as far as I know, these positions are under the enemy.

Therefore, I do not know where the Airborne Forces are and to whom it helps. ChVK ""Wagner"" continues to move inside the ""Bahmut"", therefore, the ""Bahmut"", as we will ""clap"", the task will be to hold it in the Airborne Forces or other units. Now the answer to your second question about the collapse of four aircraft, two helicopters and two planes, as the media write, under Bryansk. In order to determine how the Ukrainians could reach their territory and hit our planes, it is always necessary, first, to take the technical information of various weapons, in particular, the air defense equipment, and, second, to figure out what are the features of this situation, since this is a collective goal, roughly speaking. Four aircraft, if you draw a circle around their places of fall, it turns out that this circle is a diameter, and they all lie exactly in a circle, 40 kilometers, that is, the radius of the circle is 20 kilometers.

This is not the opinion of any authors, this is the opinion of the collective mind of the bureaucratic elite of the highest level. I call them that, so as not to offend, for example, the AP or someone else. Now let's go over the points. In their opinion, I declare that bureaucrats prevent life, because I have certain political ambitions, and I do it for populist reasons. I am fighting in Bakhmut and I want victories in it, because I want to become a hero of the war. I arranged the Bakhmut massacre not to save the Russian army and to give it the opportunity to regroup, to build muscle and all that I said, but because I'm just a nobleman. You will not believe, but it is such a conversation with such theses. I recently had a conversation with one person in a very, very high office. I say right away, not Putin, so that again no one gets confused. I emphasize this, because any of my criticism of the existing bureaucratic elite, for example, when I call the NGO a three-pointed grandfather, which may seem to be a grandfather, I'm sorry, not very smart. Everyone is trying to convey this, that it was about Putin that I spoke. Why is this a principle of a collective parasite? When you feel danger, you need to declare that it was a danger to a higher level, because a higher level should protect you from this danger. In fact, this is how the bureaucratic elite works. If you pinch them, they immediately say that they pinched the level above them. What is this for? This is done in order to raise the degree and start fighting with me collectively. Gentlemen, bureaucrats, get ready, build your battle order. I am fully prepared for this. And this person in the high office told me the following thing. You want to win the war not because you love your homeland, Russia, but because you want to enter history. Their philosophy is that only they can enter history, and others must create this history, work and die for the homeland. In Russian folklore, there is an absolutely clear definition of such a philosophy. They, the bureaucratic elite, like grandmothers from a fairy tale about a goldfish, want to eat the fish and fuck to sit down. And in general, for an ordinary person, the concept of ""Great Russia"" is a powerful self-sufficient country for many years, having a loud voice all over the world and flourishing in Russia, the Russian people. For a bureaucrat, ""Great Russia"" is a place where, being built into the bureaucratic system, he provides his comfort and has the right to enjoy power, using this power for the benefit of his own self-indulgence. Self-indulgence is a key word for them. Such a system is called feudalism. It is a system where there are hundreds of princes who, at their level, decide how to live. In the conditions of war, this is especially acute, because they decide how and when to die for our children, and their children will not only sympathize with you, but they will also laugh at your grief. They are absolutely not interested in this, they will not be touched by this. Their own well-being, the presence of a place in this parasitic chain, their well-being and the ability to engage in self-indulgence using the power they have received, touch them.",1,0

If it is not necessary to work in Ukraine, then we can free some territory in a couple of months, equivalent to approximately 20% of the territory of the African continent, taking into account the fact that less than a thousand people in just half a year made Central Africa absolutely safe. And of course, these 15-20 thousand people are not all our personnel, part of the personnel, a large part, will remain in Russia in order to further prepare for the next tasks. task.",0,0
271,1066,2023-05-27,"In our country, in the highest bureaucratic echelons, it is customary to point a finger up and say ""on top, further, the command"", while who gave the command on top, sometimes someone points up who gives the command, having himself in mind as the top. Therefore, the very fight for the Kremlin towers is conditional, this means the fight of the highest level of bureaucrats for some of their rights. So much so that I actively criticize the bureaucracy in the country, and high-level bureaucrats receive the very basic dividends, and what are the dividends for bureaucrats? This is the limitless, unlimited use of their power, and everything else is already going further. This power, as a rule, is used selflessly, but always in a plus system. Therefore, who banned the Central Channel, the major media, and so on, ChVK ""Wagner"" and me personally, there are quite a few candidates who could have done it. Perhaps some editors who either work for the top bureaucracy, or depend on this top bureaucracy, almost like all those companies that have contracts with the state, certainly, some of these people can simply insure themselves and point their finger up, because no one can check where this ""up"" is. And since it was impossible to check whether such a command was, it is better to insure ourselves. But, now, will we or I react? No, of course we will not, because in Russia there are two good proverbs. The first proverb is ""the forbidden fruit of sweeteners"". And therefore, of course, ChVK ""Wagner"" will live on in social networks, in the minds of the population, especially since we are not just promoting ourselves, we are doing business. How many of our opponents, I'm not talking about the Ukrainian media, were driving and fighting in paranoia, ""ChVK ""Wagner"" will not take Artemov"", we took him. And we took him, pay attention, on the 10th we were given a little ammunition, in May, and on the 20th Artemov was completely taken, cleared, to the last square meter. If these ammunition had appeared earlier, we would have taken it earlier. But the goal of Artemov was the Bakhmut meat grinder, the same 72,000 killed Ukrainians, the Ukrainian Armed Forces, which means that there were wounded plus or minus 100, maybe even 140, if we take the standard ratio. And this means that it is almost half of the entire Ukrainian army. This is the result of ""ChVK ""Wagner"", and therefore they talk about it, even if I and the fighters will be silent. And therefore, the military personnel carriers go to ""ChVK ""Wagner"" and receive exhaustive, 100% quality information. And the second proverb is ""You can't hide this seam in a bag"", ""ChVK ""Wagner"" is not a piece of slippery soap, which bureaucrats are used to put around everything, so that you do not know what you have in your hands. ""ChVK ""Wagner"" is a seam, it is a stiletto, which you can't hide. And therefore, in any case, they will know about it, and they will see it, and they will talk about it. And the fact that the bureaucrats of the highest level, those very towers of the Kremlin, are trying to shut up everyone around, so that they do not say ""ChVK ""Wagner"", this will only give an additional push for the people, and plus the people will add hatred to those very bureaucrats. And therefore, what are they doing? They make their lives easier for a short period, but in the long term, and the long term is a month, two, three, it's not years, they will get a slap from the people for trying to shut up the people's mouths and ears. And everything could last, as before, with pieces of soap, if they hadn't started a war. And when you start a war, be kind, have a character, will and iron balls. And then you will be able to achieve something, because any of your business is immediately visible. It is impossible to tell in the media about the buildings, bridges and metro stations that no one builds. Here is the answer to the fact that ""ChVK ""Wagner"" was banned from mentioning in the media. The question is whether I believe that it was banned, but I am absolutely sure that it was banned. Is this paper fake? I do not know if it is fake or not. If it is even fake, then 100% it is exactly the same, it lies somewhere on the next table.",0,0

As for the training of Belgorod and other border regions, the fighters of the ChVK ""Wagner"" are even experienced, even with medals and medals, it does not mean that they will properly train those who want to receive this knowledge. And even more so, they will create a training program, and even more so, they will organize people so that these people are able to properly engage in the security of the territory on which they are located as territorial defense. One of my employees from the Belgorod region, the hero of Russia, holds the leadership position of the ChVK ""Wagner"", visited one of the training centers. He saw that there is no discipline, training is held three hours a day, how many days, who came, how many came, and in addition to the lack of discipline, he saw that people sit on benches, on lawns, drink tea and various other drinks. If someone wants to learn, they come to Morkino, 12 hours a day, for a week or two, depending on the course, they prepare, after that they go home, but this does not mean that they have become full-fledged fighters of territorial defense, they have received the primary skills. Therefore, as for the Belgorod region, which we are now talking about, no one normally trains people, there is no organization, whose fault it is, the local authorities, the governor or the federal authorities, this is a separate story. But as for the fact that somewhere training is held, this is complete total nonsense. And as for the fighters of ChVK ""Wagner"", who help in training, I can tell you that the fighters from ChVK ""Wagner"" either leave for injury, or when they are removed from there, they fall into the black list. Therefore, do not think that you have good fighters running around the street, ChVK ""Wagner"", they are either at home for rehabilitation, or they are simply not very needed in ChVK ""Wagner"". As for the Belgorod region itself, I can say that a year ago I raised this issue and offered organizational assistance, of course, on an absolutely irrevocable basis, because the Belgorod region is our rear, the road of the enemy to the center of Russia. I was told that they are all right, they have the Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Federal Security Service, everyone who is necessary, they are able to protect their territory, everything they need, I emphasize, everything they need, they need funding from Moscow. As far as I understand, the funding was received, and as usual, the money is ""tyu-tyu"", and where ""tyu-tyu"" - no one knows, it is necessary to understand.

279,1084,2023-05-29,"I don't follow Strelkov's statements, I'm just not interested. Strelkov is an emotional guy, so sometimes he says something that doesn't make sense. As for the risks of a coup or a coup d'etat, it is possible in absolutely any state. In America, in Japan, anywhere. I have experienced many coups in different countries of the world, and as a rule, I was always on the side of those who were overthrown. For example, when there was a military coup in Sudan, it happened as follows. It was done by two security guards, Omar al-Bashir. I'm well immersed in how it was. Omar al-Bashir fell asleep and went to pee at 4 a.m. He was standing there, peeing in his nightgown. Suddenly, the head of his security and one of the security guards came up to him from behind and said, ""Mr. President, we have to inform you that you are under arrest."" He said, ""Who gave you such an order?"" They said, ""The Minister of Defense, AUF."" He looked at them and said, ""Guys, let me pee further."" In Russian, it would sound like, ""Guys, go fuck yourself, I want to pee."" After that, he went to sleep. He was woken up at 6 a.m. and told, ""Mr. President, you are under arrest."" That's how the military coup happened. Omar al-Bashir did not even resist. Before that, he told me, ""Let it be what it will be. You gave me a lot of good advice, but I can't use them and do them because everything has gone too far. Let me be arrested or die, but I can't change anything."" That's how it was in Sudan, for example. Therefore, in order to make a coup or a military coup, you do not need to have a large number of armed people. But, as a rule, the army makes coups. As a rule, some part of the split army. ChVK Wagner is not an army at all. This is the first. Second, we have a very respectful attitude to the President of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin. Therefore, from the ChVK Wagner's side, I do not see any prerequisites for a coup. But we must understand that the Russian Federation has a large number of special services and various departments that have armed people. By the way, we have an armed group in the Ministry of Emergency Situations, which was created by Sergei Shoigu. He created such a micro army, issued weapons, and so on. Probably, it was needed to perform some tasks. How many of these armies? Think about it. ChVK Gazprom, ChVK some other. The army, mom, do not be sad, the only disciplined, I want to emphasize, is ChVK Wagner. Therefore, ChVK Wagner is not going to make a coup. Comrade Strelkov's stories are the same as the recipes for frying a steak with blood or its cut. If there is a scheme how to cut meat and beat it, it does not mean that you are preparing to become a maniac and will be beating people on the street. The main armed force, from which we need to protect ourselves, which must be counteracted, and which can definitely. If we are not ready to give up, to make a military coup, a coup d'etat, or somehow to influence the current leadership of the country, the Russian people and our history, it is NATO, which, by the hands of the Ukrainian army, pumping it all as possible, can come to the required results, if we will relax the buns. On the question, whether the country can expect some kind of shock, I can say so, it is unlikely that the country is waiting for a bloody military coup, it is unlikely that the Kashmir revolution is waiting, but it can wait for Vaseline correction. This I refer to the relaxed buns, which we all the time talk about.",0,0

The first option is to give the command ""President"". It is possible, but it seems to me that he should be given some initial data for this. The second option is to give the command ""Sergei Vladimirovich Kirienko"". Under Kirienko there is Yarin, who often plays his games and can easily do it. Then there is Gromov Alexei Alexeevich, who is in charge, but he has no influence on the Internet and the building. It is under Kirienko. And, in fact, anyone can ask, starting from Wayne and ending with Dmitry Sergeevich Peskov, which is unlikely, because they do not have a global threat of what ChVK Wagner mentions. Therefore, I think that this is most likely an internal policy management, which is trying to minimize the society's demand for justice and the society's demand for the ""inner Russian heroes"".

Since the Kirov region has a large density of camps, I will not raise the exact numbers, I think that about 800-900 people are those who arrived from the Kirov region to the SVO zone.

And the authorities remain in their bureaucratic corruption. Therefore, opinion leaders are very important. The only thing I would argue with is the subscribers of the Telegram channels. People from different regions, different regions and not always people who can hold weapons in their hands. Therefore, if you look at my proposals for the protection of the borders, then of course the people should participate in this. And mostly those people who are in places of residence not far from the place of service, so that it is more convenient for them to defend their land. And opinion leaders, in their opinion, should participate in this. For this, we created the ChVK ""Wagner"" ""Second Front"", so that all the indifferent are not afraid to express their opinion. And we will not allow certain repressions to follow, especially from the side of the administration of the President, who will try to force the law enforcement agencies to react.

305,1130,2023-06-03,"At the moment, the conflict is settled. I talked to Ramzan, we talked and agreed that we would put this whole story on hold. What do I see the essence of the problem? Yes, of course, the statements that were, they are quite provocative. It was clear that they were trying to hurt me and bring me to the rhetoric of the 90s, so to speak, on the arrow, ""Come, let's talk like men"". What is the problem? Any, why I was silent, any inter-ethnic conflicts in Russia are then extinguished for a very long time. These statements, and the first statement was made at 3 am from Delimkhanov, suddenly unexpectedly, supposedly for the fact that I had spoken out about Ahmad in some disrespectful forms, but then many times repeated that it is not necessary to criticize the Minister of Defense and the Chief of Staff. I criticize the Minister of Defense and the Chief of Staff because I believe that they do not fulfill their duties, they did not give us shells, and I have a large number of people who have died for this reason. We will continue to deal with this until the corresponding retribution of these characters and many others has not yet reached. The second is the surrender of our Russian land. Kherson, Krasny Liman, various territories have been acquired again, but today we are beginning to lose our original Russian land. Today children die, the civilian population in Belgorod dies, and the Ministry of Defense is not able to do anything, because it does not exist, it is in chaos. Therefore, of course, I will continue to criticize. When these statements were made, and the commander of the ChVK ""Wagner"", and I realized that I would have to show their opinion, because believe me, when these statements were made in my address, then they were simply shaken and sautéed. And we could very easily come to a conflict of any level, starting simply from the showdowns on the spot. And believe me, that during the showdowns between ""Ahmat"" and ChVK ""Wagner"", the winner would be quite obvious, but there would be enough blood spilled. Moreover, no one spoke offensively about ""Ahmat"", including me, I posted a video in which it is clearly clear that there are absolutely normal relations, and I did not allow myself to criticize them in any way, but said that Ramzan ""Ahmatovich"" is right about the mobilization, I fully agree with him. As for the actions of ""Ahmat"" in the DPR, I do not know what they will do, because it is not customary to share your plans at war. This is really so, the divisions do not tell each other what they will do, and if they tell, then it is their personal prerogative to ask indecently. Therefore, those statements in my address, which were almost on the verge of insulting, but in general, did not reach it, and the subsequent response of my commanders caused a violent reaction in society. I measured, 70% of the population is extremely aggressive, 10% of the population is absolutely fair to say that it is not necessary to conflict with a two-military structure, but it is necessary to break the enemy, although we have just broken the enemy, God sees and we go on vacation. Moreover, this ""Pandora's box"" is already open, we did not open it. Ramzan did what he called me on the same day, we talked to him, and everything went on the brakes, as you can see. So, these statements were made immediately after I reported that I was sending a statement of crime to certain people from the military leadership, to the prosecutor's office and other law enforcement agencies that are engaged in this. I think that some Kremlin tower decided to play dangerous games, and in the Kremlin towers generally became common dangerous games, which they have been doing for a long time, not understanding what they are doing at all. They are simply destroying the Russian state today. The next day, they were forced, or rather, not they were forced, but the President was forced to call the Security Service to deal with the national issues. Why did I not answer the three characters that Khamsky spoke to me? Yes, for this reason, because any of my answers could be interpreted as incitement of inter-ethnic rivalry. Why? Because in Russia it happened that national minorities can speak out against Russians, and Russians cannot speak impunity against national minorities. Therefore, I was brought up in this time, when all these laws have been in force for the last 30 years, not brought up, but I was brought up in the Soviet times, with harsh laws. Therefore, I naturally kept silent in order not to make unnecessary noise and so that no one would tell me later that I was inciting inter-ethnic conflicts. In fact, this is how it is. And the reaction of social networks, I emphasize again, is not in favor of those who started this conflict. As for the further continuation, of course, if there will be such exits, then of course I am not going to ride any ""arrows"", I rode them in the 90s, and it would be stupid if a passing ""Mima"" ""9"" tinted, will open a queue, as it was there with Yamadaev, and with a bunch of people who died in such situations. As for adult serious decisions, if it is required, of course, we will, as they say, not without blessing, defend our interests, if suddenly there will be an insulting lexicon. Well, in fact, this is how it is. To this day, the conflict is still exhausted, and we discussed everything with Ramzan over the phone. And by the way, as for the commander of the ""Ahmad"" - ""Abtiy"" Aluddinov, he has already called my guys several times, since we communicate on the territory, and knowing that this whole shit is happening externally, we discussed how not to allow various conflicts and shootings on the territory. And on the territory, absolutely everything is calm, no one kills anyone. Therefore, the idea that one of those ""towers"", ""Kremlin"", ""domes"" or something else, it has failed to this day. Well, if they continue to engage in attempts to ""rip apart"" the country, then I think that this ""rip apart"" will quickly reach them and little will not show. And the second question you have is about whether we will come to the Belgorod region. Again, while we are all concentrated in the rear areas, if the Ministry of Defense in the near future does not stop what is happening in the Belgorod region, and stop the unrest that is going on to capture the territory of the Russian Federation, and is already going on to capture this territory, then certainly we will come to the Belgorod region and protect our, I emphasize, Russian people, all those who live there - Russians, Dagestanis, Chechens, anyone, ethnic Ukrainians included. And we will not wait for an invitation from someone and ask whether we can or not. The only thing is that we will need ammunition, because it is useless to come without it, as they say, with a bare ass on the frost. And about the situation in general with the Belgorod region, with the border territories and with what is happening today about the violations of the interests of the Russian Federation within the framework of this very Ministry of Defense, I was sent a whole series of videos with Zhirinovsky, who in a rather sharp manner in different years tells about what is happening. And in general, the current situation is very well explained by his words. I will not post these videos from the correctness, but if I will, then I will pick up some points that are not necessary today to ignite conflicts. But Zhirinovsky, in fact, very clearly and clearly, in many ways, spoke about such situations as the Belgorod and as the same conflict, by the way, the conditional conflict with the Chechens.",1,0

If they are not engaged in slander, this is the main problem of our army. I believe that if we are talking about the media today, then we just need to tell the truth, what is really. Do not tell sad stories that, for example, from the territory of the Belgorod region, the enemy ran back to Kharkov. And if at least some square meter of the Belgorod region has passed under the control of the enemy, we must say that this is the Russian land that is legally owned by Russia, and we have no right to give it away. And if someone gives it away, he must be punished. Therefore, my opinion and my advice is that we need to say what is really. Do not discredit the army, because the army is soldiers, it is the Russian spirit and our strength. And those who discredit it today, by ruling illiterately, they just strike this army.

And how can you make assumptions whether they are dead or not? And if they are alive, and if their mothers are waiting for them to return home, these guys, then why not take them? Someone must have balls. We have a problem with balls in the country. Where is Lapin, where is Shoygu, where is Generasimov, where is a bunch of negotiators? And so the one who goes to take the prisoners, he is not going to carry them on his shoulders, not to cover them, not to give them territory, and not to hand over weapons. He just has to go and take these guys, or die a hero. But then the country should be ready to destroy everything that is around these terrorists. When Shugalei was in prison, no one moved a finger to get him out. Only Chiviko-Wagner put everything on the line and did not leave until he was given.

Judging by the statements of the Ministry of Defense and General Konoshenko, we have long, long time ago defeated at least all the European armies, because we have almost 500 planes, 9000 tanks, and so on.

More recently, everyone has been involved in Chubais, who can only be called. Bureaucrats are a single clan that aims to plunder and destroy our Motherland. And so I believe that you are doing absolutely everything right. You are on the side of justice. Russia does not exist without justice. And the fact that bureaucrats do not need justice is alien to them. Because they want everything to be only with them, not with the Russian people. And this is exactly the trigger that will make people hear the truth, wherever it is. There are social networks, there are telegram channels. And this is a new reality. Therefore, television, the central media, which carefully filters the agenda, sprinkling it with a decolon from all sides, so that it looks beautiful, and often so that it is read by one, two or three owners of these publications, they will soon go to the background. Social networks, telegram channels and other sources of information should not be shut up. And if they tell the truth, then Russia will be great. And if they do not tell the truth, we will face the same destructive process that took place in the late 1980s and early 1990s, when lies pursued the state day and night. And whatever great ideals in Soviet times existed, they collapsed because there was no truth. It was the truth!",0,0

Technologies are very fast moving forward, and therefore now there is a race, who will make the best aircraft, and who will make the best system of its suppression and destruction. Therefore, everything that is exhibited at the exhibitions, it can not exist for this very reason. As for foreign parts, it does not matter which parts to make the aircraft today, because there is a war today. And to go to the element base of Russian production, we are obliged. But this is a very difficult process, because a huge number of bureaucrats sit in corruption schemes. And oligarchic structures, which are trying to undermine it, they are exactly the same sit in these corruption schemes.

Today they released a new device, and today they are already starting to work on counteracting it. This can only be done by a private person, immersed in this business. No state corporations, no huge enterprises are capable of this physically. And we already had such examples, when the AFK system was developing drones, which drop a bomb, and only after 10 years I realized that bombs are not relevant in the world today.

368,1257,2023-06-17,"I can say that for volunteers and for the ChVK there are both pluses and minuses in this process. Let's go by the pluses. First, you will have to describe all the weapons, and if you have any surplus, trophies, or you somehow received, you have instead of one machine gun to the platoon there turned out four, then you will have to give it to the site, and you will be easier without it. Second, the commanders of the volunteer units will be changed, and instead of the commanders who have been working with you for many years, and certainly you probably tired of them, you will come competent lieutenants or those commanders who have a good relationship with the following commanders, and those may even be relatives of someone from the high-ranking. Therefore, the replacement of the commanders is certainly a plus for you so that they do not dazzle your eyes. The next thing, of course, the volunteer units will receive the most responsible, the most tough sections of the front, where they will be able to show themselves fully without the support of tanks, artillery and other means, and will be able to really show that they are capable of serious tasks. And the last thing, I think, of the pluses, serious pluses, and no one doubts it, is actually a lifetime contract until the end of the volunteer unit, because it will be pride, as in the Tsarist Russia, if the soldier was shaved for 25 years, then he can be proud that he is a soldier. His family is a soldier, he has no children, no grandchildren, no one is fattened, his brothers will give up for him, in the end, they will continue to give birth. Therefore, the soldier will be proud. Now, as for the fact that they can additionally receive from the units of the Ministry of Defense what they are now lacking, because the volunteer units are usually built on the principle of respect, their hierarchy is obtained in battle. Here, what will be added, what will create a certain ""spicy"" moment - lack of management, lack of planning, lack of ammunition, lack of communication, lack of evacuation of the 300th, and lack of evacuation of the 200th, that is, in fact, it seems to me that this is very cool. Imagine, for example, I was just taken and killed, relatives are crying, funerals, and so I am missing, that is, I was kind of scattered to pieces. This is what they will get, of course, it will all go into the contracts, and I think that Sergei Kuznetsov will take this into account. Here is my opinion about this. Glory to the command of the Russian army, glory to the Minister of Defense and glory to the generals who sit on the floor above and below him. I don't even know if we have soldiers on the front or not. And therefore, from the signing of the contract, I see only advantages. Like a battery with two pluses, there is no minus. You take a battery with two pluses, you connect a light bulb, and the light bulb, in Russian, is called ""does not stand"". Another important point, so to speak, according to the script, at one time, when there was a colossal number of deserters in the fall of last year, when the Russian army was scattered from everywhere, then Chuvakovagner took these deserters, educated, or rather, just prepared them. They went to fight, and now these are the heroes who really fight, including in the ranks of the Red Army, fight well. A soldier is not a coward. A soldier leaves the battlefield, because the chain of commanders to the very top is solid degenerates. A Russian soldier is never a coward. A Russian soldier can fight alone, bravely and courageously, if he is not interrupted by chronic morons. [References]",1,0

A symbol of the unbending nature of people who believe in their Motherland, despite the fact that the Motherland is wiping its feet on them. Bout got into an American prison, and I remember how, sitting with my friends, we discussed and were sure that Russia would detain hundreds of American planes, arrest American frigates and do something else. But this did not happen. The same did not happen with Maksim Shugalev, who was in a Libyan prison with ISIS for nothing, and no one stood up for him until Chuvaka Wagner carried out his special operation. Bout is a symbol that the state does not care about those who can be a competitor to the state itself. Therefore, I am sure that Bout is a person who can consolidate society and replace such a worthless leader as Slutsky and the like.

But in any case, this is 108 billion rubles per month, only for one salary. Let's add insurance for injury, insurance for the event of death, and it will turn out 180-200 billion rubles per month. And you can determine for yourself whether 1.2 billion rubles is enough or not. The fact that 3% of the money, which made the announcement in its investigations, is supposed to be transferred to the participants of the SVO, and everything else is to the content of the bureaucratic apparatus, there is nothing strange about it. It is strange that at least 3% is given, because today all Russia, the whole country is engaged in only one thing - this is the content of the bureaucratic apparatus. And therefore, a huge number of people are in this bureaucratic apparatus. Another thing is that most of them do not receive enough money, but the top bureaucratic apparatus collects all the Russian money and spends it on their loved ones. Therefore, the calculator is in hand and everything is clear to the funds. I'm sorry, I said without knowing the news, and I should add one more thing. Why is all this going into open access?

And the second, as for the awards, those who perform some tasks, they are served by the Ministry of Defense or not, they receive awards. Moreover, the fighters of ChVK Wagner receive exclusively awards that anyone can receive. This is the Order of Courage, the Medal of Courage. No one is given awards that are special for the military. This is what the award system of Russia is for. And therefore, there is no need to talk, and the military analysts need to go to the trenches, stay first, and then tell fairy tales. We have Naftalinov and Dedushka every year in line, as they are ordered, they receive medals for having been loyal to the regime. And the fighters who fight, they must be the first to receive these awards, and then all the rest.

And God forbid, if this is a single group of 50-100 people. But there is no control, no weapons, no ammunition. Soldiers all day long write letters that they need shells, they need anti-tank weapons, they need grenades and armored ammunition. And so we have again the world is divided into two realities. In one place, in a horde of all, so that no one knew, so that not a single military corps did not get there, any information is jammed and the enemy goes to the side of the milk port. If he goes to the milk port, then most of the territory that was captured during the so-called SO will be returned to the enemy. The enemy begins to force Dnipro. In the first port, the first DRG appear, and today, regular troops. And all this is completely hidden from everyone. Russia will wake up one day and find out that Crimea is already given to the Ukrainians. This is a direct betrayal of the interests of the Russian Federation.

He can not stand alone on the strike, on which there must be two or three. All these numbers are carefully hidden.

In order to hold a naval parade, you need to get Moscow from the bottom of the Black Sea, which you shamefully drowned, bastards, along with Russian sailors.

407,1304,2023-06-26,"Today I opened the press service and received thousands of questions about the events that took place. In order to avoid misunderstandings, I want to answer the main questions. First, what were the prerequisites of the ""March of Justice"" of 2003-2006? ChVK ""Wagner"" is perhaps the most experienced and combat-ready unit in Russia, and perhaps in the world. Motivated, charged fighters who have performed a huge number of tasks in the interests of the Russian Federation, and always only in the interests of the Russian Federation, in Africa, in Arab countries and all over the world. Recently, this unit has achieved good results in Ukraine, having completed the most serious tasks. As a result of the intrigue of unthinkable decisions, this unit was supposed to cease to exist on July 1, 2023. The Council of Commanders has gathered, which brought all the information to the fighters. No one has agreed to sign a contract with the Ministry of Defense, because everyone knows perfectly well from the current situation of their experience during the CIS, that this will lead to a complete loss of combat ability. Experienced fighters, experienced commanders will simply be smeared and will go to the ground, where they will not be able to use their combat potential and combat experience. Those fighters who decided that they were ready to move to the Ministry of Defense, have moved. But this is a minimum number, calculated by a percentage of two. All arguments that were to save Chuvak Wagner intact and intact, were used. But none of them was realized in an attempt to enter any other structure, where we can really benefit. We were categorically against what they wanted to do. At the same time, the decision to move to the Ministry of Defense, and understanding our mood about the closure of Chuvak Wagner, the most inappropriate moments were made. Nevertheless, we set up the equipment for the grass, collected everything that was necessary, made inventory, and were going to, if the decision is not made, to go out on June 30, in a column to Rostov and publicly hand over the equipment to the headquarters of the Ministry of Defense. Despite the fact that we did not show any aggression, a missile strike was made on us. And immediately after that, the helicopters were worked out. About 30 people, fighters of Chuvak Wagner, died. Some were injured. This triggered the decision of the Soviet commanders that we must move out immediately. I made a statement in which I said that we were not going to show any aggression. But if strikes will be made on us, we will perceive it as an attempt to destroy and give an answer. During the entire march, which lasted 24 hours, one of the columns went to Rostov, the other to Moscow. In a day, we walked 780 kilometers. Not a single soldier was killed on the ground. We regret that we had to strike with air force. But these means dropped bombs and launched missile strikes. During the day, we walked 780 kilometers, not reaching 200 kilometers to Moscow. During this time, all military facilities were blocked and destroyed. No one was killed, I repeat, from those who were on the ground. And this was our task. Among the fighters of Chuvak Wagner, several people were injured and two were killed, who joined us, the military and the Ministry of Defense, at their own will. None of the fighters of Chuvak Wagner was forced to this campaign and everyone knew its ultimate goal. The goal of the campaign was not to allow the destruction of Chuvak Wagner and to bring to justice those people who, by their unprofessional actions, made a huge number of mistakes during the military-industrial complex. This was demanded by the public, all the military personnel who saw us during the march, supported us. We did not reach about 200 kilometers to Moscow, having walked 780 kilometers in both directions. We stopped at the moment when the first assault detachment, which had approached Moscow 200 kilometers away, deployed its artillery, made reconnaissance of the area, and it was obvious that a lot of blood would be spilled at that moment. Therefore, we thought that the demonstration of what we were going to do was enough. And our decision to deploy was based on two important factors. The first factor is that we did not want to spill Russian blood. The second factor is that we went to demonstrate our protest, not to overthrow the government in the country. At this time, Alexander Lukashenko reached out and proposed to find a solution for the further work of Chuvak Wagner in the legal jurisdiction. The columns turned back and went to the field camps. I want to draw your attention to the fact that our march to justice showed a lot of the things we talked about earlier. The most serious security problems throughout the country. We blocked all the military units of the airfields that were on our way. In 24 hours, we have covered a distance that corresponds to the distance from the starting point of the Russian troops on February 24, 1922, to Kiev, and from this same point to Uzhgorod. Therefore, if the actions of February 24, 1922, during the beginning of the special operation, were carried out by the units on the level of training, on the level of moral concentration and readiness to perform tasks like Chuvak Wagner, then perhaps the special operation would have lasted a day. It is clear that there were other problems, but we showed the level of organization that should correspond to the Russian army. And when on June 23-24 we were passing by Russian cities, then civilians greeted us with the flags of Russia and with the emblems and flags of Chuvak Wagner. They were all happy when we came and when we passed by. Many of them still write words of support, and some are disappointed that we stopped, because in the march of justice, in addition to our struggle for existence, they saw support for the struggle against bureaucracy and other troubles that exist in our country today. These are the main questions that I can answer in order to exclude the crookedness, both in Russian social networks and the media, and in foreign networks. So, we started our march. Because of the injustice on the road, on the ground, we did not kill a single soldier. In a day, we did not reach Moscow, we went in and completely took control of the city of Rostov. The civilians were glad to see us. We showed a master class of how it should have looked on February 24, 1922. We had no goal of overthrowing the existing regime and the legally elected authorities, which has been said many times. We turned around in order not to shed the blood of Russian soldiers.",0,0
